# HealthFlow Registry & Credentials Platform

**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

---

## Introduction

HealthFlow Registry & Credentials (HealthFlow RC) is an enterprise-grade platform for building and managing electronic healthcare registries and verifiable credentials. Built on the open-source Sunbird RC framework, HealthFlow RC provides healthcare organizations with the tools to create trusted, interoperable, and privacy-preserving digital registries.

Modern healthcare systems require reliable master data management for healthcare professionals, facilities, licenses, and credentials. HealthFlow RC addresses three critical challenges that healthcare organizations face when managing this data:

**Live Data Management.** Healthcare workforce data changes frequently as professionals move between facilities, renew licenses, and update their qualifications. Traditional systems struggle to maintain current information, leading to outdated records that compromise patient safety and regulatory compliance. HealthFlow RC enables real-time updates through self-service portals and automated verification workflows, ensuring that registry data remains accurate and current.

**Reusable Data Infrastructure.** Healthcare ecosystems involve multiple stakeholders including hospitals, insurance providers, regulatory bodies, and government agencies. Each organization traditionally maintains its own databases, leading to duplication, inconsistency, and wasted resources. HealthFlow RC provides a unified registry infrastructure with open APIs, allowing authorized systems to access verified data without redundant data collection.

**Trustworthy Credentials.** Paper-based certificates and licenses are vulnerable to fraud, difficult to verify, and time-consuming to validate. HealthFlow RC issues digitally signed verifiable credentials that can be instantly validated by any authorized party, reducing verification time from weeks to seconds while eliminating the risk of fraudulent documents.

## Healthcare Use Cases

HealthFlow RC is designed to support a wide range of healthcare registry applications:

**Healthcare Professional Registries.** Maintain authoritative records of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals with their qualifications, licenses, and practice locations. Enable instant verification of credentials by hospitals, insurance providers, and patients.

**Facility Registries.** Track healthcare facilities including hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies with their accreditation status, services offered, and operational details. Support facility discovery and referral networks.

**License Management.** Issue and manage professional licenses with automated renewal workflows, continuing education tracking, and real-time status verification. Reduce administrative burden while improving compliance.

**Credential Verification.** Provide instant verification services for healthcare credentials, eliminating manual verification processes and reducing onboarding time for healthcare professionals.

## Architecture Overview

HealthFlow RC is built on a microservices architecture that provides scalability, reliability, and flexibility:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      NGINX Reverse Proxy                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐             │
│  │  Registry   │  │ Credential  │  │   Claims    │             │
│  │   Service   │  │   Service   │  │   Service   │             │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘             │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐             │
│  │ Certificate │  │   Identity  │  │ Notification│             │
│  │   Service   │  │   Service   │  │   Service   │             │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PostgreSQL │ Elasticsearch │ Redis │ Kafka │ Keycloak         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The platform consists of the following core components:

**Registry Service.** The central service that manages schemas, entities, and workflows. It automatically generates REST APIs based on schema definitions and handles all CRUD operations with built-in validation and authorization.

**Credential Service.** Generates W3C-compliant verifiable credentials with support for multiple signature algorithms (RSA, Ed25519) and issuer-specific key management.

**Claims Service.** Manages attestation workflows, allowing designated authorities to verify and approve credential claims before issuance.

**Identity Service.** Provides decentralized identity management with support for multiple authentication methods and key recovery.

**Certificate Service.** Generates visual representations of credentials in PDF, SVG, or HTML format with embedded QR codes for verification.

**Notification Service.** Handles email and SMS notifications for workflow events, credential issuance, and system alerts.
